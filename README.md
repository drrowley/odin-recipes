# odin-recipes

I will create a website consisting of an index page which links to a few recipe pages, using html. I will be using command line and git to create it.

firstly i set up a repo in github and then moved that onto my local machine and set this readme file up.

I am comfortable with the html but I have not used git before so I will be learning this skill in this project.
